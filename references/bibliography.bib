	Abstract = {In the world of targeted learning, cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimators, CV-TMLE [Zheng:2010aa], has a distinct advantage over TMLE [Laan:2006aa] in that one less condition is required of CV-TMLE in order to achieve asymptotic efficiency in the nonparametric or semiparametric settings. CV-TMLE as originally formulated, consists of averaging usually 10 (for 10-fold cross-validation) parameter estimates, each of which is performed on a validation set separate from where the initial fit was trained. The targeting step is usually performed as a pooled regression over all validation folds but in each fold, we separately evaluate any means as well as the parameter estimate. One nice thing about CV-TMLE, is that we average 10 plug-in estimates so the plug-in quality of preserving the natural parameter bounds is respected. Our adjustment of this procedure also preserves the plug-in characteristic as well as avoids the donsker condtion. The advantage of our procedure is the implementation of the targeting is identical to that of a regular TMLE, once all the validation set initial predictions have been formed. In short, we stack the validation set predictions and pretend as if we have a regular TMLE, which is not necessarily quite a plug-in estimator on each fold but overall will perform asymptotically the same and might have some slight advantage, a subject for future research. In the case of average treatment effect, treatment specific mean and mean outcome under a stochastic intervention, the procedure overlaps exactly with the originally formulated CV-TMLE with a pooled regression for the targeting.},

@article{schafer2007,
	Abstract = {When outcomes are missing for reasons beyond an investigator's control, there are two different ways to adjust a parameter estimate for covariates that may be related both to the outcome and to missingness. One approach is to model the relationships between the covariates and the outcome and use those relationships to predict the missing values. Another is to model the probabilities of missingness given the covariates and incorporate them into a weighted or stratified estimate. Doubly robust (DR) procedures apply both types of model simultaneously and produce a consistent estimate of the parameter if either of the two models has been correctly specified. In this article, we show that DR estimates can be constructed in many ways. We compare the performance of various DR and non-DR estimates of a population mean in a simulated example where both models are incorrect but neither is grossly misspecified. Methods that use inverse-probabilities as weights, whether they are DR or not, are sensitive to misspecification of the propensity model when some estimated propensities are small. Many DR methods perform better than simple inverse-probability weighting. None of the DR methods we tried, however, improved upon the performance of simple regression-based prediction of the missing values. This study does not represent every missing-data problem that will arise in practice. But it does demonstrate that, in at least some settings, two wrong models are not better than one.},

@article{Cai2019,
	Abstract = {The Highly-Adaptive-LASSO Targeted Minimum Loss Estimator (HAL-TMLE) is an efficient plug-in estimator of a pathwise differentiable parameter in a statistical model that at minimal (and possibly only) assumes that the sectional variation norm of the true nuisance functional parameters (i.e., the relevant part of data distribution) are finite. It relies on an initial estimator (HAL-MLE) of the nuisance functional parameters by minimizing the empirical risk over the parameter space under the constraint that the sectional variation norm of the candidate functions are bounded by a constant, where this constant can be selected with cross-validation. In this article, we establish that the nonparametric bootstrap for the HAL-TMLE, fixing the value of the sectional variation norm at a value larger or equal than the cross-validation selector, provides a consistent method for estimating the normal limit distribution of the HAL-TMLE. In order to optimize the finite sample coverage of the nonparametric bootstrap confidence intervals, we propose a selection method for this sectional variation norm that is based on running the nonparametric bootstrap for all values of the sectional variation norm larger than the one selected by cross-validation, and subsequently determining a value at which the width of the resulting confidence intervals reaches a plateau. We demonstrate our method for 1) nonparametric estimation of the average treatment effect based on observing on each unit a covariate vector, binary treatment, and outcome, and for 2) nonparametric estimation of the integral of the square of the multivariate density of the data distribution. In addition, we also present simulation results for these two examples demonstrating the excellent finite sample coverage of bootstrap-based confidence intervals.},

@article{robins1994,
	Abstract = {In applied problems it is common to specify a model for the conditional mean of a response given a set of regressors. A subset of the regressors may be missing for some study subjects either by design or happenstance. In this article we propose a new class of semiparametric estimators, based on inverse probability weighted estimating equations, that are consistent for parameter vector α0 of the conditional mean model when the data are missing at random in the sense of Rubin and the missingness probabilities are either known or can be parametrically modeled. We show that the asymptotic variance of the optimal estimator in our class attains the semiparametric variance bound for the model by first showing that our estimation problem is a special case of the general problem of parameter estimation in an arbitrary semiparametric model in which the data are missing at random and the probability of observing complete data is bounded away from 0, and then deriving a representation for the efficient score, the semiparametric variance bound, and the influence function of any regular, asymptotically linear estimator in this more general estimation problem. Because the optimal estimator depends on the unknown probability law generating the data, we propose locally and globally adaptive semiparametric efficient estimators. We compare estimators in our class with previously proposed estimators. We show that each previous estimator is asymptotically equivalent to some, usually inefficient, estimator in our class. This equivalence is a consequence of a proposition stating that every regular asymptotic linear estimator of α0 is asymptotically equivalent to some estimator in our class. We compare various estimators in a small simulation study and offer some practical recommendations.},

@article{Gutman2015,
	Abstract = {Estimation of causal effects in non-randomized studies comprises two distinct phases: design, without outcome data, and analysis of the outcome data according to a specified protocol. Recently, Gutman and Rubin (2013) proposed a new analysis-phase method for estimating treatment effects when the outcome is binary and there is only one covariate, which viewed causal effect estimation explicitly as a missing data problem. Here, we extend this method to situations with continuous outcomes and multiple covariates and compare it with other commonly used methods (such as matching, subclassification, weighting, and covariance adjustment). We show, using an extensive simulation, that of all methods considered, and in many of the experimental conditions examined, our new 'multiple-imputation using two subclassification splines' method appears to be the most efficient and has coverage levels that are closest to nominal. In addition, it can estimate finite population average causal effects as well as non-linear causal estimands. This type of analysis also allows the identification of subgroups of units for which the effect appears to be especially beneficial or harmful.},

@article{Rubin2007,
	Abstract = {For estimating causal effects of treatments, randomized experiments are generally considered the gold standard. Nevertheless, they are often infeasible to conduct for a variety of reasons, such as ethical concerns, excessive expense, or timeliness. Consequently, much of our knowledge of causal effects must come from non-randomized observational studies. This article will advocate the position that observational studies can and should be designed to approximate randomized experiments as closely as possible. In particular, observational studies should be designed using only background information to create subgroups of similar treated and control units, where 'similar' here refers to their distributions of background variables. Of great importance, this activity should be conducted without any access to any outcome data, thereby assuring the objectivity of the design. In many situations, this objective creation of subgroups of similar treated and control units, which are balanced with respect to covariates, can be accomplished using propensity score methods. The theoretical perspective underlying this position will be presented followed by a particular application in the context of the US tobacco litigation. This application uses propensity score methods to create subgroups of treated units (male current smokers) and control units (male never smokers) who are at least as similar with respect to their distributions of observed background characteristics as if they had been randomized. The collection of these subgroups then 'approximate' a randomized block experiment with respect to the observed covariates.},

@article{Rubin2005,
	Abstract = { Causal effects are defined as comparisons of potential outcomes under different treatments on a common set of units. Observed values of the potential outcomes are revealed by the assignment mechanism---a probabilistic model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on such inference, a distinction evident in Fisher's discussion of tests of significance versus tests in an accept/reject framework. But Fisher never used the potential outcomes framework, originally proposed by Neyman in the context of randomized experiments, and as a result he provided generally flawed advice concerning the use of the analysis of covariance to adjust for posttreatment concomitants in randomized trials. },
